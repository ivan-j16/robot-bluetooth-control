# robot-bluetooth-control
Application that sends signals to connected bluetooth device. 

In the use case of the project, the arduino catches these signals through the HC-05 bluetooth module. Once caught, commands are run to move the robot forward, back, left, right and to make it play a pre-recorded sound.
